# Predicting Smoking Status using XGBoost Binary Classification Model
This repository contains a machine learning model built using XGBoost, achieving an AUC score of 0.7908 to
predict an individual's smoking status based on various health indicators. The model utilizes a binary 
classification approach to determine whether a person is a smoker or non-smoker.

Key Details:
Model Used: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Performance: Achieved AUC Score: 0.7908
Objective: Predicting Smoking Status (Binary Classification)

Features Used:
The model leverages multiple health indicators, including but not limited to:
Haemoglobin levels
Systolic blood pressure
Other relevant health parameters

Repository Contents:
Data: Includes the dataset used for training and evaluation.
Code: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Results: Model performance metrics, evaluation reports, and visualizations.
